# Data Cleaning

Cleaning the data is a crucial initial step that must be taken before working with any data, as the anomalies and inconsistencies present in the data can vary from one dataset to another. It is unfortunate that without data cleaning, no progress can be made, which emphasizes the primary and essential nature of this step in comparison to all other steps.

# Train-Test split

The process of dividing data into two parts, namely training and testing data, is known as a train-test split. The training data is utilized to train the model, as its name implies, while the testing data is employed to assess its performance. It's also necessary to specify the train-test ratio for the split.

After this step we are left with four values which are as follows.

1. X train

2. X test

3. Y train

4. Y test.

# Vectorization

Converting data into numerical form is a necessary step because machines comprehend numerical values more effectively. In the given document, I executed the count vectorizer, although in certain instances, the Td-idf vectorizer may also be employed.
